## General Information
- A case study on loan data to determine defaulters such that the lending club can minimize the risk of lending loans
- The data is cleaned by taking out the unnecessary columns, and by formatting important numeric and date columns. Various charts and graphs are produced to describe the data. A conclusion is given at the end of each analysis
- To determine how the lending club can minimize the risk while lending loans and increase profitability 
- A dataset of ~40k loan records is used for analysis.

## Conclusions
- The lending club should prefer giving loans to those who have their own house than people renting houses or having a mortgage on their home
- Although, the number of loan-takers are more in lower-middle income category, the lending club should pay caution while disbursing loan to people in this income range
- Although, the number of loan-takers are more with the rate of interest between 11% to 15%, but we can see the count from other categories is still higher
- The lending club can be cautious deciding the rate of interest for loan-takers in the income category 
- The results are a bit contradictory when it comes installment payment amount. It seems people with a smaller installment to pay are tending to default on their loan more than people with bigger installment to pay
- The lending club should recalibrate their installment payment formulas so that it stands >$600 per month
- Loan takers who typically pay a lower monthly installment with an interest rate between 10% to 17% are defaulting on their loan more than the rest of the group
- The loan term doesnâ€™t seem to have an impact on defaulting a loan
- The lending club must be very careful granting loans to unemployed people
- The lending club must pay caution while lending loans to those people who employers are in Defense, Retail, or Postal service
- While the population of defaulters is largest in 10+ years employment length category, it is obvious that people are taking and defaulting on loan if they have <1 year of service
- The lending club need to pay caution while lending loans to people with <1 year of employment
- People with 6 to 9 years of employment length tend to be defaulting less on their loan
- The lending club need to very careful while lending loan to those who are taking it for debit consolidation 
- The lending club need to very careful while determining the loan amount and the installment amount 
- The installment amount is also correlated with annual income of the person
- The lending club must use a scoring mechanism (like credit rating) before granting a loan to its members
